# MemoryCardGame

---

MemoryCardGame is a web-based interactive memory matching card game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Players are presented with a grid of cards, each hiding an image. The objective is to find all matching pairs by flipping two cards at a time. The game tracks the number of moves and time spent, challenging players to improve their memory and beat their best scores. 

Features include:
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Animated card flipping effects
- Score and timer tracking
- Easy-to-customize card images and grid size

This project is great for anyone looking to have fun while exercising their memory skills or learning fundamental web development concepts.
